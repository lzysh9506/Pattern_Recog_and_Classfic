# Pattern_Recog_and_Classfic

Because of the uploading limitation, the GloVe corpora didn't upload as file.  
It can be download on https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/, and I used the Pre-trained word vectors with Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5 (B tokens, 400K vocab, uncased, 200d vectors) to pre-trained CNN model.

The report of the project could be found in `Report_final.md`.
